This is a software implementation of the Fast IO control system used on the Taito Type X arcade system

The primary goal is to create a software package that can be dropped in instead of using the original hardweare for testing and development purposes.
This was not created to allow people to play bootlegged/pirated games.
Due to the above this will more than likley remain non user firendly and be a static implementation where ifdef will be used as a make shift config
This is also a free project where you are more than welcome to take this and extend it how ever you like. as long as this repo is credited and if you improve the base code please submit your changes.
